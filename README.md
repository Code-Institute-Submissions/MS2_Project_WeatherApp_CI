## Features 

Go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so. Explain what value each of the features provides for the user, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how this project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

### Existing Features


- __The landing page__

  - The landing includes a photograph with text overlay to allow the user to see exactly which location this site would be applicable to. 
  - This section introduces the user with simple layout to grab their attention
  - No navigationbar included

- __Search section__

  - This section will allow the user to search weather by city name, for quick information.
  - Code will clear userinput in the searchbox after submission, for ease of use in case user wishes to perform another search for another city directly after. 
  - Only a searchbox is initially displayed. Once the user enters a cityname, and clicks the button to generate results, an infocard will appear with weather data, see next section.

- Once user has clicked the submit button, following weather results for city are generated:
  - Weather icon (connected to data for description result, i.e if description is "partly cloudy", an icon will display two clouds). See an image below.
  - Cityname
  - Temperature (rounded number)
  - Description

### Features Left to Implement

- Instead of a search field, the developer could opt to use geolocation to provide current weather for user's area, without the user having to type in a city. A geolocation feature is outside the scope of this project, as I wish to dmonstrate that the user can search for any major city or town with the help of this app. 

## Testing 

Go over all of projectâ€™s features, make sure that they all work as intended. How can user easily achieve their goals when using the service.
- API tests 1 (different, easier API) and API 2 sharp test generated expected results. 

Include functionality in different browsers and screen sizes.

Bugs or problems during testing: script placement (ok), alert box(ongoing), math.round(ok).


### Validator Testing 

- HTML
  - No errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.o.''html)
- CSS
  - No errors were found when passing through the official [(Jigsaw) validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator''.''s)

### Unfixed Bugs
